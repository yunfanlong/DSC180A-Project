    <h3>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</h3>
    <p>I really liked the GCN, which is very similar to CNN and can help for network tasks, which I felt very interesting.</p>

    <h3>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</h3>
    <p>I would like to pursue handling long range interaction in GCN related topics. This can include optimization/modification to the network for better long-range interaction handling.</p>

    <h3>What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</h3>
    <p>A potential change is that instead of documenting the project in google docs, now I can document it in latex, which is more formal and elegant.</p>

    <h3>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</h3>
    <p>I would be interested in using some of the advanced optimization techniques, specifically those for handling long range interaction to set stage for quarter 2 Project.</p>
