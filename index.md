### What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

I really liked the GCN, which is very similar to CNN and can help for network tasks, which I felt very interesting.

### Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

I would like to pursue hadling long range interaction in GCN related topics. This can include optimization/modification to the network for better long-range interaction handling.

### What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

A potential change is that instead of documenting the project in google docs, now I can document it in latex, which is more formal and elegant.

### What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would be interested in using some of the advanced optimization techniques, specifically those for handling long range interaction to set stage for quarter 2 Project.
